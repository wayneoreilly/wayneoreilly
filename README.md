#  Hi, I’m Wayne O’Reilly  

I’m an aspiring **Software Engineer** with a foundation in IT Support (CompTIA A+ & Per Scholas alumni).  
Currently pursuing a **B.S. in Software Engineering at WGU** and learning to build projects in **Python and web development**.  

- I’m passionate about technology because I love the idea of creating tools, apps, or websites that solve real problems — without depending on a 3rd party.  
- Right now, I’m focusing on beginner-friendly projects like scripts, portfolio sites, and small applications to sharpen my skills.  
- My goal: grow into a professional software engineer through continuous learning, hands-on projects, and apprenticeship opportunities.
